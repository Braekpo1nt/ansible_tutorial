# this is meant to be run for a fresh server we just set up, which has never had ansible run against it before, and we want to add the initial configuration to the server so our other ansible scripts can run against it. 
# because `ansible.cfg` has `remote_user = simone`, successive ansible scripts don't need the `--ask-become-pass` to run
# All you need to do to the server is add the `ansible.pub` ssh public key to its `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file (the `ansible.pub` file is configured in `ansible.cfg` e.g. `private_key_file = ~/.ssh/ansible`)
