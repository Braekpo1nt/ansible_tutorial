This is where the roles live. Each role needs its own directory. Each role dir has a `tasks` dir where the playbooks are stored. `main.yml` has to be the main task file. 

The `files` subdirectory is where you should put a role's relevent files

The `handlers` subdirectory is where you put the role's handlers
